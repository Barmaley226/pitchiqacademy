      <article class="feature-card">
        <h3>1. Basic Cone Weave</h3>
        <p><strong>Session length:</strong> 5–10 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Age group:</strong> All ages</p>
        <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> 1 ball, 6-10 cones</p>
         <p><strong>Skills developed:</strong> Ball control, dribbling, turning</p>
        <h4>Setup</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Use a 20-yard section of the field.</li>
          <li>Place the first cone to mark the starting point.</li>
          <li>Place a second cone 5 yards away to begin the weaving section.</li>
          <li>Set 5 cones 1 yard apart to form the weave.</li>
          <li>Place the final cone 5 yards beyond the last cone to finish the drill.</li>
          <li>All players start behind the first cone. For 6+ players, create a second identical course.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Player 1 (P1) starts by dribbling toward the cone weave.</li>
          <li>P1 dribbles in and out between the cones until completing the weaving section.</li>
          <li>After rounding the final cone, P1 passes to Player 2 (P2) and moves to the back of the line.</li>
          <li>P2 then repeats the drill. Players should focus on controlling the ball and avoiding cones.</li>
          <li>Gradually increase speed as players get comfortable.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Variations</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Dribble using only the right foot.</li>
          <li>Dribble using only the left foot.</li>
          <li>Dribble weaving from right-to-left or left-to-right.</li>
          <li>Introduce a timed challenge to see who completes the course fastest (penalties for losing control).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep short, frequent touches and stay light on your feet — shorten touches when increasing speed.</p>

        <h3>2. Zig-Zag Dribbling Drill</h3>
        <p><strong>Session length:</strong> 5–10 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Age group:</strong> All ages</p>
        <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> 1 ball per player, 6–8 cones</p>
        <p><strong>Skills developed:</strong> Ball control, dribbling with speed, using inside, outside, and sole of the foot</p>
        <h4>Setup</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Arrange cones in a zig-zag pattern about 5 yards apart.</li>
          <li>The total length of the course should be approximately 20 yards.</li>
          <li>Players start at the first cone, each with a ball.</li>
          <li>SIf the group is large, split into two lines with identical zig-zag setups.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>The first player dribbles through the zig-zag, weaving around each cone.</li>
          <li>When reaching the end, sprint back with the ball to the starting line.</li>
          <li>Repeat the drill several times so players get comfortable controlling the ball while changing directions.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Coaching Points</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep touches controlled and close.</li>
          <li>Alternate between inside, outside, and sole of the foot.</li>
          <li>Gradually increase dribbling speed without losing control.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> 3. Ronaldinho Box Drill</h3>
        <p><strong>Session Length:</strong> 5–10 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Age Group:</strong> All ages</p>
        <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> 1 ball per player, 16–20 small cones</p>
        <p><strong>Skills Developed:</strong> Ball control, footwork, agility, creativity</p>
        <h4>Drill Setup</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Arrange 16–20 cones in a 4×4 square grid (increase spacing for older players).</li>
          <li>Players start with a ball inside the square; if multiple players, take turns.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Move the ball around the cones using different parts of the foot: inside, outside, sole and toe.</li>
          <li>Keep touches tight and change direction frequently while moving creatively around the box.</li>
          <li>Use both feet and vary tempo; perform several 30–60s rounds with short rest between.</li>
          <li>Progress by increasing speed or adding a small competitive element (who completes most controlled moves).</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Variations</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Use only the dominant foot for one round, then only the weaker foot for another.</li>
          <li>Include a short juggling sequence between touches for ball mastery.</li>
          <li>Time each player and create a friendly challenge or require a minimum number of moves per round.</li>
          <li>Challenge players to invent and perform a new move while keeping the ball in the box.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Coaching Points</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep the ball close to maintain control; small quick touches work best.</li>
          <li>Encourage creativity and fluid movement rather than large, wild kicks.</li>
          <li>Use low center of gravity and keep head up regularly to develop spatial awareness.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Focus on rhythm and tempo first, then add speed — quality of touch over flashy moves.</p>

        <h3>4. Dribbling + Acceleration Drill</h3>
        <p><strong>Session Length:</strong> 10–15 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Age Group:</strong> All ages</p>
        <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> 1 ball, 8–9 cones</p>
        <p><strong>Skills Developed:</strong> Dribbling, footwork, acceleration, stamina</p>
        <h4>Drill Setup</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Place 4–5 cones in a zig-zag pattern, about 3–4m apart.</li>
          <li>After the zig-zag, set 4 cones in a straight line for a short cone weave.</li>
          <li>Mark a 10–20m sprint line after the last cone.</li>
          <li>Each player starts with a ball at the first zig-zag cone.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Drill Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Dribble through the zig-zag section with controlled touches.</li>
          <li>After the last zig-zag cone, move directly into the straight cone weave, keeping the ball close.</li>
          <li>When finished the weave, leave the ball at the last cone and accelerate into a 10–20m sprint to the finish line.</li>
          <li>Jog back, collect the ball, return to the start and rotate players smoothly to maintain intensity.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Coaching Points</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep touches close and controlled while changing direction.</li>
          <li>Focus on balance when turning around cones.</li>
          <li>The sprint must be explosive — full acceleration; practice quick transitions from dribbling to running.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Variations</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>No sprint.</li>
          <li>Add a timed challenge for more intensity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Emphasize quality of touch during the dribble and maximum effort on the sprint.</p>
